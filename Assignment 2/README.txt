# Running

main.py tests both methods.  To run it:

    python3 main.py <dataFile>

While running, the program will ask the user to input 3 fields:

- Ranking method (either 't' or 'b' for tf_idf or bm25 respectively)
- Query (terms separated by spaces)
- Number of returned results (an integer)

To stop the program at any time, use the kill command, CTRL + C.
